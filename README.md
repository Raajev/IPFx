This edit as suggested by Adam Carrgilson from Norwich BioScience Institutes (https://www.nbi.ac.uk/)
This Branch includes option to increment/decrement values  of more than 255 in one subnet. And required changes are carried out in higher subnet class.
e.g. If in an IP address of 10.11.12.13, 256 is added, resultant value will be 10.11.13.13
